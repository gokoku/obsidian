## TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS

Almost heaven West Virginia

Blue Ridge Mountain Shenandoah River

<br>

Life is old there older than the trees

Younger than the mountains Growin' like a Breeze

<br>


(*)
Country Roads take me home To the place I belong

WestVirginia mountain momma

Take me home Country Roads

<br>

All my memories gather 'round her

Miner's lady stranger to blue water

<br>

Dark and dusty painted on the sky

Misty taste of moon shine Teardrop in my eye

<br>

(*)  Repeat

<br>

I hear her voice in the mornin' hours she calls me 

the radio reminds me of my home far away 

and Drivin' down the road

I get a feelin' That I should have been home

Yesterday, Yesterday

<br>

(*)  Repeat
